- Poor articulation of features or their impact (e.g. task sync ‚Üí faster execution)
- Missed upsell cues (e.g. CS team, HR, marketing)
- Overlooked opportunities to pitch deployment flexibility, smart cue cards, or instant answers
- Bad competitive framing or over-reliance on basic feature descriptions
